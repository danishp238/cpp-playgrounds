In this deep dive, we explore Highway Driver‚Äîa deceptively simple game that captures the chaos, strategy, and reflexes of the open road. From real-world driving psychology to game design secrets, we‚Äôll break down:
        ‚úÖ How highway survival games train your brain (faster reactions, better focus)
        ‚úÖ Clever game mechanics inspired by actual driving challenges (lane-switching, speed fatigue, tunnel vision)
      ‚úÖ Behind-the-scenes coding & design choices (why obstacles spawn just right)
      ‚úÖ Fun upgrades to turn a basic prototype into a full-fledged game (weather, AI traffic, boss chases!)
